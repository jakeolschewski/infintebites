        personalized plans, and curated product recommendations, including affiliate product bundles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parts of the guidance we provide are generated or assisted by AI models and decision-support tools,
        which are designed to augment — not replace — professional medical advice from your pediatrician
        or other qualified health providers.

      <h3>4.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
      <p>We collect information that you choose to give us, for example when you generate a plan, use AI features, subscribe, or contact us.</p>
      <dl class="data-list">
        <div>
          <dt>Baby’s age and concern</dt>
          <dd>
            When you use InfantBites, you can enter your baby’s age in months and select a concern
            (such as feeding, solids, growth, or other topics). We design this input to be 
            non-identifying on its own and recommend that you avoid including your child’s name or other
            identifiers within free-text fields.

        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>AI prompts and inputs</dt>
          <dd>
            When you interact with AI-assisted features (for example, asking follow-up questions about a plan),
            we collect the text you type and related context so that our AI models can generate responses.
            Please avoid entering more sensitive personal information than is necessary for the question you’re asking.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>Premium subscription and billing information</dt>
          <dd>
            If you purchase a premium subscription, we and our payment processors collect information such as your email address,
            plan type, billing country or postal code, limited payment card details (like last four digits and expiry date),
            and transaction identifiers. We do not store your full card number or CVV.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>Contact information (optional)</dt>
          <dd>
            If you choose to receive your plan by email, sign up for updates, or contact us for support,
            we collect your email address and any information you include in your message.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>Feedback and survey responses (optional)</dt>
          <dd>
            If you respond to surveys, give feedback, or participate in research or beta features,
            we may collect your responses, ratings, and comments to improve the Service and our AI systems.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>Data request information</dt>
          <dd>
            When you submit a privacy request (such as export or deletion), we collect the email address and 
            request details you provide so we can identify your records, verify your identity, and respond.
          </dd>
        </div>
      </dl>

      <h3>4.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <p>When you use the Service, some information is automatically collected, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address and approximate location (city or region, not precise address);</li>
        <li>Browser type, language, device type, and operating system;</li>
        <li>Referring URL (how you arrived at our website);</li>
        <li>Pages and features you use, time and date of visits, and interactions (clicks, scrolls);</li>
        <li>Performance data (load times, errors, and diagnostics) to help keep the Service reliable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3 Affiliate Interaction Data</h3>
      <p>
        When we show you product bundles or affiliate recommendations, we may track:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which product links you click;</li>
        <li>When those clicks happen;</li>
        <li>Whether a partner reports a purchase attributed to our referral (where applicable).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use this primarily to understand which recommendations are helpful, improve our suggestions,
        support compliance with FTC endorsement guidance, and receive credit from partners.
      </p>

      <h3>4.4 Aggregated and De-identified Data</h3>
      <p>
        We may create aggregated and/or de-identified data from your information (for example, statistics
        about usage by age range). This data does not reasonably identify you and may be used to improve
        our AI models, service design, and business decisions.
      </p>

      <h3>4.5 Information We Prefer Not to Receive</h3>
      <p>
        We do not need and do not want information like your child’s full name, full postal address, or
        highly sensitive medical details to provide general guidance. Please avoid including this type
        of information in prompts, messages, or uploads.

    <!-- 6A. Premium Subscriptions -->
    <section id="section-premium" class="policy-section" aria-labelledby="premium-heading">
      <h2 id="premium-heading">6A. Premium Subscriptions, Billing &amp; Access</h2>

      <p>
        InfantBites may offer optional paid subscriptions (“<strong>Premium</strong>”) that provide enhanced tools,
        AI capabilities, expanded usage limits, or other upgraded features. This section explains how we collect,
        use, and protect information associated with premium purchases, from a privacy perspective.
      </p>

      <h3>6A.1 Information we collect</h3>
      <p>When you subscribe to Premium, we and our payment processor may collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your email address (required to activate and manage your subscription);</li>
        <li>Plan details (such as monthly/annual, tier, start and renewal dates);</li>
        <li>Billing country or postal code (for tax rules and compliance);</li>
        <li>Limited payment details (card brand, last four digits, expiration month/year);</li>
        <li>Transaction identifiers, invoice records, receipts, refund or chargeback status;</li>
        <li>Entitlement status (active, paused, canceled, expired).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> store your full payment card number or CVV. Those are handled by our secure third-party
        payment processor, which processes payments on our behalf.
      </p>

      <h3>6A.2 How we use subscription and billing information</h3>
      <p>Your subscription-related information is used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain access to Premium features;</li>
        <li>Authenticate your entitlement across sessions and devices;</li>
        <li>Send important billing or account communications;</li>
        <li>Process payments, refunds, and chargebacks;</li>
        <li>Detect, investigate, and prevent fraud or unauthorized use;</li>
        <li>Fulfill tax, accounting, and other legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6A.3 AI usage and Premium tiers</h3>
      <p>
        Premium plans may include higher monthly prompt limits, longer responses, more advanced models,
        or priority access to AI features. The privacy rules in Section 7 apply equally to free and Premium AI usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paying for Premium does <strong>not</strong> change our core privacy commitments: we do not sell your personal information,
        and we do not intend for your identifiable personal information (such as your email or billing details)
        to be used to train general-purpose AI models that are accessible outside our relationship with you.
      </p>

      <h3>6A.4 Subscription renewals</h3>
      <p>
        If you enroll in a subscription with automatic renewal, your plan will renew at the then-current price,
        unless you cancel before the renewal date. Where required by law, we will notify you about material
        price or terms changes.
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-info">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Your purchase and use of any Premium plan are also governed by our Terms of Use or
        subscription agreement, which describe pricing, renewals, feature eligibility, usage rules, and limitations of liability.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- 6B. Refunds & Cancellations -->
    <section id="section-refunds" class="policy-section" aria-labelledby="refunds-heading">
      <h2 id="refunds-heading">6B. Refunds, Cancellations &amp; Chargebacks</h2>

      <p>
        This section explains how we handle your information when you cancel, request a refund, or dispute a charge.
        It complements our Terms of Use, which describe refund eligibility, timeframes, and local consumer rights.
      </p>

      <h3>6B.1 Cancelling your subscription</h3>
      <p>
        You may cancel your Premium subscription at any time (for example, via your account settings
        or the platform where you subscribed). When you cancel:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Premium access typically remains active until the end of the current billing period;</li>
        <li>Your payment method will not be charged again unless you reactivate;</li>
        <li>We retain a limited record of your subscription and transactions for tax, audit, and fraud-prevention purposes;</li>
        <li>Your underlying InfantBites data remains governed by this Privacy Policy until you request deletion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6B.2 Refund requests</h3>
      <p>
        Whether a refund is available depends on our then-current refund policy, the platform you used to purchase (website, app store, etc.),
        and applicable law. To evaluate a request, we may review:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your purchase and billing history;</li>
        <li>Your entitlement status and recent feature usage;</li>
        <li>Any indicators of fraud or unauthorized use;</li>
        <li>Relevant consumer protection rules in your region.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our payment processor typically executes the approved refund. We maintain a record of refund requests
        and outcomes (for example, approved, declined, partial) to comply with legal obligations and prevent abuse.
      </p>

      <h3>6B.3 Chargebacks</h3>
      <p>
        If you dispute a charge with your bank or payment provider (a “chargeback”), we receive notice
        and may share limited supporting information with the payment processor to resolve the dispute.
        We may retain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chargeback reason codes and dates;</li>
        <li>Evidence submitted (such as proof of access or prior usage);</li>
        <li>Outcome records (won/lost);</li>
        <li>Indicators of potential fraud or repeated abusive disputes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6B.4 AI usage and refunds</h3>
      <p>
        Canceling or refunding your subscription does not automatically delete the prompts or interaction
        history already processed by our systems (free or premium). That information continues to be handled
        according to this Privacy Policy, including Section 7 (How We Use AI &amp; Automated Systems).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want us to delete or export personal information in connection with a cancellation or refund,
        you can submit a separate privacy request using the form in Section 16 (“Submit a Data Request”)
        or by contacting us directly.
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Refund and cancellation rights can vary depending on where you live
        and how you purchased your subscription (for example, our website vs. an app store).
        If you need legal advice about your consumer rights, please consult a qualified attorney.

    <!-- 7. How We Use AI -->
    <section id="section-ai" class="policy-section" aria-labelledby="ai-heading">
      <h2 id="ai-heading">7. How We Use AI &amp; Automated Systems</h2>
      <p>
        InfantBites uses AI and other automated systems to generate guidance and recommendations.
        These tools help us deliver more personalized and context-aware support, but they do not replace professional
        medical advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI features are available in both free and premium tiers. While Premium may unlock additional capacity or capabilities,
        the core privacy protections described in this section apply across all tiers.
      </p>

      <h3>7.1 Types of AI-assisted features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Generating tailored feeding and development guidance based on your inputs;</li>
        <li>Suggesting follow-up questions or clarifications;</li>
        <li>Summarizing information you provide in an easier-to-read format;</li>
        <li>Ranking or recommending product bundles that may be relevant to your situation;</li>
        <li>Improving our models using aggregated and de-identified usage patterns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.2 Information sent to AI providers</h3>
      <p>
        To provide these features, we may send certain information — such as your prompts, baby’s age in months,
        selected concerns, and contextual usage details — to AI infrastructure providers that operate models on
        our behalf. These providers act as our service providers (sometimes called “processors”) and are
        contractually limited to using the information only to provide services to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We design our prompts to minimize the amount of personal information included and encourage you not
        to share more detail than is necessary for your question.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 Training and improvement of AI systems</h3>
      <p>
        We may use anonymized or aggregated information from your interactions (for example, prompts with
        identifying details removed, usage statistics, and model outputs) to evaluate and improve our AI systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not intend for your identifiable personal information (such as your email address or full billing details)
        to be used to train general-purpose AI models that can be accessed outside of our relationship with you.
        Where we rely on third-party AI providers, we seek to configure and contract with them in a way that prevents
        your identifiable personal data from being used to train their foundation models for other customers.
      </p>

      <h3>7.4 Human review</h3>
      <p>
        We may occasionally review a small sample of interactions (for example, prompts with identifying
        details removed) to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Audit AI output quality and safety;</li>
        <li>Investigate abuse, misuse, or technical issues;</li>
        <li>Improve user experience and product design.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where possible, this review is conducted on data that is aggregated, pseudonymized, or de-identified.
      </p>

      <h3>7.5 No fully automated decisions with legal or similarly significant effects</h3>
      <p>
        InfantBites does not use AI to make decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects
        about you without human involvement (for example, we do not use AI to determine eligibility for
        essential services or credit).
      </p>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        <strong>Reminder:</strong> InfantBites is for informational purposes only and does not provide
        medical diagnosis or treatment. Always consult your pediatrician or another qualified health
        provider with questions about your child’s health.

          <p>
            You enter information (like age in months and concerns), interact with AI features, subscribe to premium,
            or contact us. We also collect limited technical information (like device type) to keep things running.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2. Process</h3>
          <p>
            Our systems — including AI models — use your inputs to generate guidance, personalize content,
            enforce usage limits, and measure what’s working. Some processing happens via trusted service providers.

        <li>
          <h3>3. Store</h3>
          <p>
            We store necessary information in secure systems for as long as needed to provide the Service,
            improve it, comply with law, and honor your choices.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>4. De-identify (where possible)</h3>
          <p>
            Where we can, we remove or transform identifiers so information is aggregated or de-identified.
            This helps us learn from usage patterns without directly tying every insight back to a specific person.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>5. Delete or archive</h3>
          <p>
            When information is no longer needed, we delete it or anonymize it. In some cases we may keep limited
            records as required by law (for example, proof that we responded to a privacy request or processed a refund).

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent</strong> – for example, when you ask us to email your plan or agree to optional analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Contract</strong> – where processing is necessary to provide the Service you request, including AI-assisted features and premium subscriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – such as improving the Service and AI systems, preventing fraud, 
          and running analytics, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests.</li>

        <li>
          <strong>Business transfers.</strong> If we undergo a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion

        InfantBites is designed for use by adults (parents and caregivers), not children. 
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

      <p>
        The only child-related detail we ask for is age in months, which we treat as non-identifying.
        Please do not share your child’s full name, address, or other identifying information with us
        in prompts, messages, or free-text fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, 
        please contact us using the details below so we can delete it.
      </p>

      <h3>13.1 Parental consent and COPPA (U.S.)</h3>
      <p>
        For users in the United States, we aim to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act 
        (“COPPA”) where it applies. Our Service is directed to adults; we do not knowingly allow children 
        under 13 to create accounts or provide personal information directly to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we ever introduce features that are directed to children under 13 in the U.S., we will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Obtain <strong>verifiable parental consent</strong> before collecting personal information from a child;</li>
        <li>Provide parents with clear notice of what information is collected, how it is used, and with whom it may be shared;</li>
        <li>Allow parents to review, delete, and refuse further collection or use of their child’s personal information;</li>
        <li>Limit our collection to what is reasonably necessary for the activity or feature in question.</li>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Does InfantBites use my data to train AI?</summary>
        <p>
          We may use anonymized or aggregated information from your interactions to evaluate and improve our AI systems.
          We do not intend for identifiable personal information (like your email or full billing details) to be used
          to train general-purpose models that are accessible outside our relationship with you.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can someone else see what I type into the AI?</summary>
        <p>
          Day to day, interactions are processed automatically by our systems and service providers. We may review
          a small sample of anonymized or de-identified interactions to audit safety and quality, investigate abuse,
          or debug technical issues.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is AI making decisions about my child’s health?</summary>
        <p>
          No. InfantBites provides informational guidance only. It does not diagnose, treat, or make medical decisions.
          You remain responsible for decisions about your child’s health, and you should always consult your pediatrician
          or another qualified health provider.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I use InfantBites without AI?</summary>
        <p>
          Some core features rely on AI, so turning AI off completely may not be possible. However, you can always
          choose how much detail you share and you can stop using the Service at any time. You can also request
          deletion of your data.
