      <h2>22. Governing Law, Dispute Resolution & Class Action Waiver</h2>
      <p>
        (a) <strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms and your use of the Site are governed by the laws of
        <strong>[INSERT PRIMARY STATE/PROVINCE AND COUNTRY]</strong>, without regard to its conflict of laws rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) <strong>Arbitration (where permitted by law).</strong> Where enforceable, any dispute, claim, or
        controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Site (a “Dispute”) shall be resolved exclusively
        by binding individual arbitration, and not in court, except that either party may seek injunctive or equitable
        relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened misuse of intellectual property or
        confidential information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in
        <strong>[INSERT CITY AND STATE/PROVINCE]</strong> under the rules of
        <strong>[INSERT ARBITRATION BODY, E.G., AAA OR JAMS]</strong> in English.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) <strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND INFANTBITES AGREE
        THAT ANY DISPUTE SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
        ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS OF
        MULTIPLE PERSONS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) <strong>Fallback to Courts.</strong> If a court or arbitrator determines that the arbitration agreement or
        class action waiver is unenforceable as to you, or if applicable law prohibits arbitration of certain Disputes,
        then those Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in
        <strong>[INSERT CITY AND STATE/PROVINCE]</strong>, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow mandatory arbitration or class action waivers for consumers. In such cases,
        this section applies only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

    <section id="misc">
      <h2>23. Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>
        (a) <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, together with any other documents expressly incorporated by
        reference (including our Privacy Policy), constitute the entire agreement between you and InfantBites regarding
        your use of the Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) <strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that
        provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions shall remain in
        full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) <strong>No Waiver.</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be
        deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) <strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations
        hereunder without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these
        Terms without restriction.
