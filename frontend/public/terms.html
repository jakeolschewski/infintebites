          <li>You can usually manage or cancel your Subscription through your account settings on the Site or, if purchased through a third-party app store, through that app store account.</li>
          <li>Cancellations generally take effect at the end of your current Billing Period, and you will continue to have access until that time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          (e) <strong>Upgrades, Downgrades &amp; Plan Changes.</strong> If you upgrade your plan or switch to a higher
          tier, we may charge you a prorated amount for the remainder of the current Billing Period or start a new
          Billing Period as explained at the time of the change. If you downgrade or switch to a lower tier, the change
          may take effect at the end of your current Billing Period unless stated otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          (f) <strong>Trials, Introductory Offers &amp; Promotions.</strong> We may, from time to time, offer free trials,
          discounted introductory periods, or other promotions for Paid Services. The specific terms (including duration,
          eligibility, and whether a Subscription automatically converts to a paid plan) will be shown at sign-up. If a
          trial converts to a paid Subscription, we will charge your payment method at the end of the trial unless you
          cancel before the trial ends, as explained when you sign up.
        </p>

        <p>
          (g) <strong>Refund Policy.</strong> Unless:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>we clearly state otherwise on the Site or at the time of purchase for a particular Paid Service (for example, a specific “money-back guarantee”); or</li>
          <li>a refund is required under the laws that apply to you (including any Non-Excludable Rights described in Section 18),</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          then:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All fees for Paid Services (including premium Subscription fees) are non-refundable and non-creditable; and</li>
          <li>We do not provide refunds or credits for partial or unused Billing Periods, for content you did not use, or for any downgrade or cancellation you make during a Billing Period.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If we choose, in our sole discretion, to provide a refund, discount, or credit on one occasion, that does not
          create an obligation to do so again, even in a similar situation.
        </p>

        <p>
          (h) <strong>Statutory Cooling-Off &amp; Consumer Rights.</strong> If you are a consumer in a jurisdiction that
          grants a statutory “cooling-off” period, right of withdrawal, or other mandatory refund or cancellation rights
          for digital services, we will honour those rights to the extent required by law. Details of such rights may be
          explained in your local consumer laws and in our <a href="/privacy-policy" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a> or
          other documents referenced in these Terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          (i) <strong>Third-Party Platforms &amp; App Stores.</strong> If you purchase a Paid Service through a third
          party, such as Apple’s App Store, Google Play, or another platform, your billing relationship may be with that
          third party and not directly with InfantBites. In that case:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Billing, renewal, and cancellation will be governed by the third party’s terms and policies; and</li>
          <li>Any requests for refunds generally must be directed to that third party, subject to applicable law.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          (j) <strong>Failed Payments; Suspension.</strong> If a payment cannot be completed (for example, due to
          expiration of your payment method, insufficient funds, or a payment processor failure), we may:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Attempt to re-process the payment using the same or an updated payment method; and/or</li>
          <li>Temporarily suspend or permanently cancel your access to the applicable Paid Services (including premium features) until payment is successfully received.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          (k) <strong>Chargebacks &amp; Disputes.</strong> If you initiate a chargeback or payment dispute that is found
          to be unsupported or abusive, we may, to the extent permitted by law, suspend or terminate your access to Paid
          Services and/or pursue any rights or remedies available to us.
        </p>

        <p>
          (l) <strong>Price Changes.</strong> We may change the prices for Paid Services from time to time. For
          Subscriptions, any price change will apply to the next Billing Period and, where required by law, we will give
          you advance notice and information about how to cancel if you do not wish to continue at the new price.

        <p>
          (a) <strong>AI Tools &amp; Outputs.</strong> We may use automated systems, algorithms, or tools, including
          third-party artificial intelligence (“AI”) services (collectively, <strong>“AI Tools”</strong>), to help suggest,
          generate, summarize, or organize Content (for example, recipe ideas, ingredient swaps, or generalized
          educational explanations).
        </p>
        <p>
          Any Content produced, assisted, or organized by AI Tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is still “Content” under these Terms and is provided for general informational and educational purposes only;</li>
          <li>May be incomplete, outdated, misleading, or inaccurate, and may omit relevant information;</li>
          <li>May not be suitable or safe for your specific child, household, or circumstances; and</li>
          <li>Must never be treated as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or emergency care.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          (b) <strong>No Personalized Medical Guidance.</strong> AI Tools used on or in connection with the Site are not
          designed to provide, and must not be used to obtain, personalized medical, nutritional, or safety guidance
          for a specific child or family. You agree that you will not rely on any AI-assisted output as the basis for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Decisions about medical treatment, allergy management, or developmental concerns; or</li>
          <li>Any urgent or emergency response.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          (c) <strong>Data Processing &amp; Third-Party AI Providers.</strong> To provide AI-assisted features, we may
          send certain data (which may include prompts or other inputs you provide) to third-party AI providers. Any
          such processing will be conducted in accordance with our
          <a href="/privacy-policy" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a> and the contracts we have with those providers.
          We do not control how those third parties design their models or training data and do not guarantee that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>AI-generated outputs will be unique or free of similarity to outputs provided to others; or</li>
          <li>AI-generated outputs will be free of bias, error, or harmful suggestions.</li>

          (d) <strong>Information You Provide to AI-Assisted Features.</strong> You are responsible for the information
          you choose to submit to any AI-assisted feature. In particular, you agree that you will not:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide more personal or health information about your child or household than is reasonably necessary to use the feature as intended; or</li>
          <li>Intentionally share highly sensitive data (for example, full medical records or highly detailed personal identifiers) except as clearly described in our Privacy Policy and required to provide a specific service.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          (e) <strong>AI Safety &amp; Limitations.</strong> You understand and agree that AI Tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have technical limitations and may generate text that appears confident but is inaccurate or unsafe;</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          (f) <strong>Your Use of AI-Assisted Outputs.</strong> Subject to these Terms, you may use AI-assisted outputs
          provided by the Site for your personal, non-commercial purposes. You remain solely responsible for how you use
          and act on those outputs, including how you adapt recipes or suggestions for your child.
        </p>

        <p>
          (g) <strong>No Guarantee of Confidentiality.</strong> We take reasonable steps to protect your information as
          described in our Privacy Policy, but we cannot guarantee that AI-assisted outputs will be confidential or
          unique. You should not provide information you consider highly sensitive or confidential unless the specific
          feature clearly indicates how it is protected and you are comfortable with that use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Automated or AI-assisted tools do not replace professional judgment, clinical decision-making, or the advice
          of your child’s healthcare providers.

      <!-- 25. Governing Law -->
      <section id="governing-law" class="legal-section">
        <h2>25. Governing Law, Dispute Resolution &amp; Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p>
          (a) <strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms and your use of the Site are governed by the laws of
          <strong>[INSERT PRIMARY STATE/PROVINCE AND COUNTRY]</strong>, without regard to its conflict of laws rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) <strong>Arbitration (where permitted by law).</strong> Where enforceable, any dispute, claim, or
          controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Site (a “Dispute”) shall be resolved exclusively
          by binding individual arbitration, and not in court, except that either party may seek injunctive or equitable
          relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened misuse of intellectual property or
          confidential information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in
          <strong>[INSERT CITY AND STATE/PROVINCE]</strong> under the rules of
          <strong>[INSERT ARBITRATION BODY, E.G., AAA OR JAMS]</strong>, in English.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) <strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND INFANTBITES AGREE
          THAT ANY DISPUTE SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
          ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS OF
          MULTIPLE PERSONS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) <strong>Fallback to Courts.</strong> If a court or arbitrator determines that the arbitration agreement or
          class action waiver is unenforceable as to you, or if applicable law prohibits arbitration of certain Disputes,
          then those Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in
          <strong>[INSERT CITY AND STATE/PROVINCE]</strong>, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow mandatory arbitration or class action waivers for consumers. In such cases,
          this section applies only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

        <h2>26. Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>
          (a) <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, together with any other documents expressly incorporated by
          reference (including our Privacy Policy), constitute the entire agreement between you and InfantBites regarding
          your use of the Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) <strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that
          provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions shall remain in
          full force and effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) <strong>No Waiver.</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be
          deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) <strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations
          hereunder without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these
          Terms without restriction.
