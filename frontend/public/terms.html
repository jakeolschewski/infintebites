        </p>
        <p>
          (b) <strong>Arbitration (where permitted by law).</strong> Where enforceable, any dispute, claim, or
          controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Site (a “Dispute”) shall be resolved exclusively
          by binding individual arbitration, and not in court, except that either party may seek injunctive or equitable
          relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened misuse of intellectual property or
          confidential information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in
          <strong>[INSERT CITY AND STATE/PROVINCE]</strong> under the rules of
          <strong>[INSERT ARBITRATION BODY, E.G., AAA OR JAMS]</strong>, in English.

          THAT ANY DISPUTE SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
          ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS OF
          MULTIPLE PERSONS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) <strong>Fallback to Courts.</strong> If a court or arbitrator determines that the arbitration agreement or
          class action waiver is unenforceable as to you, or if applicable law prohibits arbitration of certain Disputes,
          then those Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in
          <strong>[INSERT CITY AND STATE/PROVINCE]</strong>, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
        </p>
        <p>
